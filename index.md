## Academic Summary
My thesis research involved finding semantic representations for phrases and short sentences where connective syntax is sparse and background knowledge is extremely important. This work plays a role in semantic browsing of text as well as semantic matching and browsing of non-textual objects that are associated with natural language descriptions. I have also enjoyed working on knowledge base representation for non-expert users and on noun compound resolution.

I performed this work with Dr. Scott E. Fahlman, in the Scone Knowledge Representation Group at CMU.

I am also interested in Machine Translation (MT), and I spent one year as a Visiting Researcher at the University of Karlsruhe, maintaining the shared CMU/UKA Arabic-English Statistical MT System.

From September 2006 to July 2008 I pursued my thesis work remotely from Tokyo, Japan, where I had the opportunity to collaborate with the Tsujii Laboratory of the University of Tokyo on their GENIA project.

In July 2008 I joined Alelo, a serious-game technology company in Los Angeles.

Please take a look at my publications and our knowledge-browsing tool, SconeEdit. You may also download my curriculum vita and my thesis: “Textual Inference for Retrieving Labeled Object Descriptions”.
